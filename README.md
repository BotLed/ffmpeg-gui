## Update: Feb 3, 2025
-> I've moved on to developing a newer release of this GUI written in C++ / Qt. Tkinter is great as an intro to GUI development practice but its extremely limited. The option was there to move to PyQt but if I'm being honest I strongly dislike the over-simplicity of Python, as well as many other things about it.\
-> I might eventually release a stable version, just because maybe occasionally I'll want to use the Python vesion.
   

### Disclaimer
This is my absolute first ever GUI made with tkinter that I whipped up because I use ffmpeg frequently and got tired of using the command line.
Over time it will become more polished, this is version two.
*WARNING*: insanely unstable, there's currently a ton of bugs
